        <h3> How to make a orgami Envelope?</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Take a square paper</li>
            <li>Take the right corner over to the left corner and make a small pinch in the very center.</li>
            <li>Now take the bottom corner up to the top and make another small pinch in the center. This gives you an X mark.</li>
            <li>Fold the left and right corners to meet the center of the X.</li>
            <li>Bring the top corner to the center and make a light mark in the middle. You now have a crease mark.</li>
            <li>Fold the bottom corner up to the crease mark, keeping the left and right edges straight.</li>
            <li>Unfold your paper.</li>
            <li>Fold the right edge of the bottom section inwards, aligning with the crease you just made, and unfold.
            <li>Fold the left side in the same way and unfold.</li> 
            <li>Fold the bottom corner up to the crease that is indicated.</li> 
            <li>Re-fold the lower right section. Take note of the X that is on the lower central flap underneath. The top right point of the X aligns with the top left corner of the flap on top.</li>
            <li>Open out the lower section, make a new mountain fold from the central flap, fold the right section underneath the central flap.</li>

            <li>Do the same on the left side.</li>
            <li>Re-fold the lower section back up.</li>
            <li>Insert the left and right flaps inside the central section that is now on the inside.</li>
            <li>You could use a dab of glue on the flaps to keep them secure.</li>
            <li>Fold the top down.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h3> How to make a orgami Octahedronxs?</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Take a sheet of Rectangular paper.</li>
            <li>Start with your paper white side up. Fold the paper in half bottom to top, and then unfold the paper.</li>
            <li>Fold the bottom right corner and align with the center crease, and then unfold. You should have a horizontal crease. Fold the top right corner and align with the center crease. You should now have two creases.</li>
            <li>Fold the paper in half bottom to top, and then fold the right diagonal crease to the left. Flip the paper over, top to bottom. Fold the bottom right corner up to the left and align with the top edge.</li>
            <li>Flip the paper over again and repeat the process. Each time, the triangle aligns with the top edge. Repeat until you get to the end of the paper. Flip it over to the back and fold the little edge in as well.</li>
            <li>Unfold the paper, making sure the paper is on the side where the horizontal crease in the center is a mountain fold. Fold the paper almost in half, aligning the creases. Unfold and flip over. The crease you just made should be a mountain fold.</li>
            <li>Fold the paper back in half. At the same time, fold the mountain creases inside. The top crease should point to the left and the bottom crease should point to the right. Fold the left vertical crease backward. Fold the top left section over the bottom section and unfold.</li>
            <li>Make the end of the top left section a valley fold. Open the lower section to create the octahedron. Tuck the top left flap into the right section keeping the top right section together. Tuck the top right section into the gap. Now you should have a three-dimensional octahedron.</li>
        </ol>
